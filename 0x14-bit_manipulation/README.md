This project is BIT Manipulation

In the project, we'll talk about writinf a function that;

1, converts a binary number to an unsigned int

2, prints the binary representation of a number

3, returns the value of a bit at a given index

4, sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

5, sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

6, returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another

7, checks the endianness

8, checks the password of a program.
